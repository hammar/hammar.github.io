Below you will find a subset of the code that I've been involved in and that has been publicly released.

## Semantic tools

* [CoModIDE](https://comodide.com) - A plugin for the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu) ontology editor that supports graphical drag-and-drop based composition of ontologies, supported by an embedded Ontology Design Pattern library. Developed in collaboration with [Cogan Shimizu](http://coganshimizu.com) of the [Data Semantics Lab](http://daselab.cs.ksu.edu) at Kansas State University.
* [ExcelRDF](http://karlhammar.com/ExcelRDF/) - An Excel VSTO plugin that provides light-weight translation from OWL to XLS, and from XLS to RDF, to enable linked data generation from existing Excel-based tools and workflows. Intended as a very light-weight [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) alternative.
* [XD for WebProtégé](https://github.com/hammar/webprotege) - This is a fork of the [WebProtégé](https://github.com/protegeproject/webprotege) ontology engineering environment that adds support for Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) and the eXtreme Design ODP usage method. Features include an ODP browser/search engine, and wizards for importing and specializing ODPs. Makes use of [XdpServices](https://github.com/hammar/XdpServices) project for backend features.
* [OntoTouch](http://www.ontotouch.com/) - HTML 5 webapp mockup of a user interface for an ontology prototyping tool intended to run on tablet computers. Won 2nd prize at the [ESWC 2012 Summer School](http://summerschool2012.eswc-conferences.org/) student project competition. We are convinced that the use case and the prototype user interface are viable, and are considering continuing development on this project.

## Other projects
* [noteboard](https://github.com/hammar/Noteboard) - A simple Google App Engine webappthat emulates posters stuck to a whiteboard.
* [lminimumcover](https://code.google.com/p/lminimumcover/) - A simple web app built on top of Google App Engine that takes as input a set of functional dependencies, and returns a calculated L-minimum cover to this set.
* [shortener](https://code.google.com/p/shortener/) - Shortener is an iPhone application that provides quick access to various URL shortening services. For a brief time, before Twitter clients got the same capabilities, this app filled a hole in the market. I've since retired it from the App Store but the source is available for download.
