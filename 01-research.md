The first stage of my PhD project (in Swedish the Licentiate or PhL degree) concerned the development of quality criteria and associated quality indicators for Ontology Design Patterns. The latter half of my PhD project extended upon this work by developing methods and tooling to simplify the development and use of high-quality Ontology Design Patterns. Subsequently I have begun exploring challenges in ontology visualisation, modularisation, and the decoupling of ontology interface and implementation.

Below you'll find some more information about my research contributions. You can also visit the [publications page](/publications/) for a full list of papers I've authored.

## Projects
* *Building Knowledge -- Modular Knowledge Graphs Enabling Adaptive Real Estate* (2019-2020). A 4.8 MSEK (455 000 €) postdoctoral project funded by the [Knowledge Foundation](http://www.kks.se/) under the KK Prospect grant programme. The goal of the project is to explore the intersection of semantic knowledge graphs and machine learning technologies, and to develop and evaluate approaches to modular ontology engineering based on design patterns. Co-production partners from industry: [Vasakronan](https://vasakronan.se/), [Akademiska Hus](https://www.akademiskahus.se/), [Willhem](https://willhem.se/), and [Klipsk](https://klipsk.io/).
* [RealEstateCore](https://realestatecore.io). The RealEstateCore Consortium supports the development of the RealEstateCore ontology and associated specifications, API:s, components, etc. The School of Engineering at Jönköping University is a founding member of the consortium; I represent the university in the consortium's governing board, and on the technical committee.

## Awards
* *Future Organisation of the Year* award by [Energieffektiviseringsföretagen](https://www.eef.se/) for the [RealEstateCore](https://www.realestatecore.io/) initiative
