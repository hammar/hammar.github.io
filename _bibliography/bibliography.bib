@inproceedings{hammar2019realestatecore,
	Abstract = {Recent developments in data analysis and machine learning support novel data-driven operations optimizations in the real estate industry, enabling new services, improved well-being for tenants, and reduced environmental footprints. The real estate industry is, however, fragmented in terms of systems and data formats. This paper introduces RealEstateCore (REC), an OWL 2 ontology which enables data integration for smart buildings. REC is developed by a consortium including some of the largest real estate companies in northern Europe. It is available under the permissive MIT license, is developed and hosted at GitHub, and is seeing adoption among both its creator companies and other product and service companies in the Nordic real estate market. We present and discuss the ontology's development drivers and process, its structure, deployments within several companies, and the organization and plan for maintaining and evolving REC in the future.},

	Abstract = {Ontology engineering is traditionally a complex and time-consuming process, requiring an intimate knowledge of description logic and predicting non-local effects of different ontological commitments. Pattern-based modular ontology engineering, coupled with a graphical modeling paradigm, can help make ontology engineering accessible to modellers with limited ontology expertise. We have developed CoModIDE, the Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE, to develop and explore such a modeling approach. In this paper we present an evaluation of the CoModIDE tool, with a set of 21 subjects carrying out some typical modeling tasks. Our findings indicate that using CoModIDE improves task completion rate and reduces task completion time, compared to using standard Prot{\'e}g{\'e}. Further, our subjects report higher System Usability Scale (SUS) evaluation scores for CoModIDE, than for Prot{\'e}g{\'e}. The subjects also report certain room for improvements in the CoModIDE tool -- notably, these comments all concern comparatively shallow UI bugs or issues, rather than limitations inherent in the proposed modeling method itself. We deduce that our modeling approach is viable, and propose some consequences for ontology engineering tool development.},
