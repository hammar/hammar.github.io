  cpas-ext:solutionDescription "Two classes are defined, the :Object class and the :Record class. Instances of the former represent the certainly known or verified instances of the entities being modelled, whereas instances of the latter represent records or snapshots of things that have been stated about the former, but which do not reach the same level of certainty. Instances of the two classes are linked by the :isRecordOf and :hasRecord object properties, which are defined to be functional and inverse functional, respectively. Object- or datatype properties carrying the specific domain knowledge linkage or facts are defined as subproperties of :objectOrRecordLinkage (object properties) or of :objectOrRecordAttribute (datatype properties). The domain of both of these properties is the union of :Object and :Record, i.e., all datatype or object properties can be applied to either a :Record or :Object. To differentiate between the certainly known and the less certainly known facts at query time, the user checks for explicit typing of the node using the property as either an :Object or a :Record."^^xsd:string ;
