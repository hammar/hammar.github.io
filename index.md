![Karl Hammar](/assets/images/karl.jpg)

I am a lecturer in computer technologies at [Jönköping University](http://ju.se/en.html), where I develop and manage the [Software Engineering and Mobile Platforms](http://ju.se/jth/utbildning/ingenjorsprogram/mjukvaruutveckling-och-mobila-plattformar.html) bachelor program. I'm also a PhD student, with a research interest in Ontology Design Patterns for the Semantic Web. My research questions concern what qualities these patterns need to display in order to be useful in different ontology engineering scenarios, a problem which is studied from both technical and a usability-oriented perspectives.

Karlhammar.com is my personal web page, which I update occasionally but not overly frequently. It holds various things that I am involved in that may be of interest to others also.
