I am a computer scientist and software developer. Research-wise I work with knowledge representation and ontologies for the Semantic Web; specifically, I focus on methods and tools supporting ontology engineering in real-world scenarios, ranging from building automation to veterinary syndromic surveillance.

Karlhammar.com is my personal web page, which I update occasionally but not overly frequently. It holds various things that I am involved in that may also be of interest to others.
