I am a technical PM at Microsoft where I work in industry solutions. 

Previously I was a computer scientist and department head at [Jönköping University](https://ju.se), Sweden. My research focused on methods and tools supporting ontology engineering in scenarios ranging from building automation to veterinary syndromic surveillance. I obtained my PhD from [Linköping University](https://liu.se). 

Most of my recent work research and development work has targeted the Smart Buildings domain, where I've been fortunate enough to make some impact as co-founder of the [RealEstateCore project](https://dev.realestatecore.io).
