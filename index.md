I am a lecturer in computer technologies at <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://ju.se/"><span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CollegeOrUniversity" itemid="https://ju.se/"><span itemprop="name">Jönköping University</span></span></a>. I'm also a computer science researcher, working with knowledge representation and ontologies for the Semantic Web. My research focuses on the development of methods and tools supporting ontology engineering in real-world scenarios, ranging from building automation to veterinary syndromic surveillance.

Karlhammar.com is my personal web page, which I update occasionally but not overly frequently. It holds various things that I am involved in that may also be of interest to others.
